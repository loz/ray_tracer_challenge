module Spectator::Matchers
  # Provides common methods for matchers.
  #
  # The `#match` and `#negated_match` methods have an implementation
  # that is suitable for most matchers.
  # Matchers based on this class need to define `#match?` and `#failure_message`.
  # If the matcher can be negated,
  # the `#failure_message_when_negated` method needs to be overriden.
  # Additionally, the `#does_not_match?` method can be specified
  # if there's custom behavior for negated matches.
  # If the matcher operates on or has extra data that is useful for debug,
  # then the `#values` and `#negated_values` methods can be overriden.
  # Finally, define a `#description` message that can be used for the one-liner "it" syntax.
  abstract struct StandardMatcher < Matcher
