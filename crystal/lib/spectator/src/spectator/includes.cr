# This file includes all source files *except* `should.cr`.
# The `should.cr` file contains the optional feature for using should-syntax.
# Since this is disabled by default, we don't include all files.
# Including all files with a wildcard would accidentally enable should-syntax.
# Unfortunately, that leads to the existence of this file to include everything but that file.

# FIXME: Temporary (hopefully) require statement to workaround Crystal issue #7060.
# https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/7060
# The primary issue seems to be around OpenSSL.
# By explicitly including it before Spectator functionality, we workaround the issue.
